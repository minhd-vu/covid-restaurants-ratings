<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->
## About The Project

Rate restaurants' COVID-19 prevention practices and stay safe in the middle of the pandemic.

### Introduction

The COVID-19 global pandemic has brought a major change to social interactions which have created new social norms. Our new normal is practicing social distancing and ensuring safe, preventive actions such as wearing a face mask. This new normal is now the basic expectation in our restaurant/food industry. Unfortunately, virus prevention plans have not been implemented nor standardized everywhere. Many businesses still fail to implement necessary practices and have been the root of major outbreaks. Furthermore, our priorities and preferences as consumers have changed. Our top preference is the execution of safe COVID prevention practices. In order to bring security in a society of social anxiety, our project aims to provide that piece of mind. 

Our project is a restaurant COVID rating application. It is a platform where businesses will be rated by their COVID prevention practices. Consumers will be able to rate a restaurant based on its measures to stop the spread of COVID-19. These reviews can be accessed by other health-conscious consumers to ultimately help decide on where to eat.  Especially as restaurants are reopening, it is imperative that consumers are well educated on the restaurant’s preventative practices. The application will provide other helpful information relating to COVID like providing live traffic reports and parking/walking space situation. Overall, our project caters to the new universal preference and demand. 

### Importance

Restaurant COVID ratings are important because we are in an era where one minor mistake can lead to hundreds to thousands of new COVID-19 cases. Our project will ensure consumers are making the safest possible decision when they choose where to eat, not only for their safety, but for the safety of the people around them. We want to make sure that the proper precautions are being taken when we choose to consume food made by people other than ourselves. Furthermore, we will confirm said precautions are being taken by restaurants and allow people to choose where to eat comfortably without worrying about their safety. Additionally, this project can help business owners as well. It will bring awareness to and promote those businesses that are taking the time and effort to ensure safe practices.  

During the COVID-19 pandemic, people are trying to find safe ways to continue living their lives. With our project, people can help each other on which places to avoid, based on safety guidelines. Restaurants do require people to wear masks, but in many places, not all the rules are followed.  Our project will provide a tool that will help individuals make decisions on where they want to eat. It will be people providing their own versions of a restaurant’s health score. With hospitals exhausted because of the pandemic, our goal is to play a small part in reducing the amount of people who could catch the virus.
